# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Erik Murray. I'm a broadcast engineer dabbling in Python scripting to streamline operations at our radio station!

### Iâ€™m currently working on:
- [Transmitter Reading Web App](https://github.com/ErkMurIndustries/BurkReadingFlaskApp)
  - This project uses the Burk API to automatically fill transmitter logs though it would work as webpage to manually input reading as well. It requires an operator to digitally approve the readings before posting them to a SQL Database. I'm still implementing EAS logging into the system.

### Language I code in
- Python
- Javascript
- SQL 
- HTML (Jinja2 Templating)
