# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Erik Murray. I'm a broadcast engineer dabbling in Python scripting to streamline operations at our radio station!

### Iâ€™m currently working on:
- [Transmitter Reading Web App](https://github.com/erikjmurray/BurkReadingFlaskApp)
  - This project uses the Burk API to automatically fill transmitter logs though it would work as webpage to manually input reading as well. It requires an operator to digitally approve the readings before posting them to a SQL Database. I'm still implementing EAS logging into the system.

- [Personal Website / Blog](https://github.com/erikjmurray/erikjmurray.github.io)
  - I've built a personal blog using a Jekyll framework to dynamically create a static website. This project is hosted by GitHub pages and is accessible at [erikjmurray.com](https://erikjmurray.com). 
  - I used this project as a front-end refresher. I overwrote the default theme and designed everything from scratch. 

### Language I code in
- Python
- Dart / Flutter
- Javascript
- SQL 
- HTML (Jinja2 Templating)
